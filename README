 |  Mainline Linux kernel for H3 devices  |
 +========================================+

This kernel tree is primarily intended for Orange Pi PC, Orange Pi One, and Orange Pi 
Zero. However, you can easily modify the appropriate .dts files and port it to 
other H3-based boards.

WHAT WORKS:

- Ethernet driver
- USB host controllers
- CPU frequency and voltage scaling (cpufreq)
- Thermal regulation (CPU-based cooling)
- HDMI driver
- USB OTG port (for USB gadgets)


TODO:

- SPI flash support
- Audio support
- Video decoding support
